# Hi there, I am Debangana Ghosh ðŸ‘‹
Aspiring Data Scientist | ML and remote sensing enthusiast | B.Tech (IT), University of Calcutta

ðŸ”­ I'm passionate about applying **Machine Learning, Deep learning and Computer vision** to solve real-world problems - from **NLP chatbots** to **Drone based agricultural vision systems**
ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm exploring **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data** and how AI can unlock insights from Earth Observations 
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open-source projects in **Machine Learning and Remote sensing and Computer vision**
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with **advancing** my knowledge of SAR preprocessing, scaling ML models for geospatial data
ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about** Machine learning model building, NLP chatbots, Computer Vision pipelines for imagery analysis and getting started with python, tensorflow and data preprocessing
